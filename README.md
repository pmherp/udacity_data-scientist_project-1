## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

For visualization of treemaps, installation of plotly.express is necessary. Apart from that, there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand: 
- 1
- 2
- 3

## File Descriptions
There is a jupyter notebook including all the code of my analysis. Moreover I included a python file mapping countries to continents that I found _here_.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available _here_.
