## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

For visualization of treemaps, installation of plotly.express is necessary. Apart from that, there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

Due to upload limits, I was not able to upload the CSV-Files here as well, but they can be downloaded from [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020).

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand: 
- Is there a difference between continents regarding the mean workinghours per week?
- Is there a difference between different age groups regarding the mean working hours per week?
- Is there a difference between gender when it comes to working hours per week?
- Is there a difference in the distribution across continents when it comes to age groups and gender regarding the mean working hours per week?

## File Descriptions
There is a jupyter notebook including all the code of my analysis. Moreover I included a python file for all functions used in the code and another python file mapping countries to continents that I found [here](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/986163).

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available _here_.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aitzaz/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020).

Also I want to give credit to Pamela Fox, who provided the python file for mapping countries to continents.
